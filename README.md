Introduction
The AI-Powered Airport Navigation System provides a seamless, easy-to-use interface to guide passengers through every step of their airport journey. Leveraging computer vision, machine learning models, and real-time data integration, it gives travelers personalized guidance, helping them save time and reduce the stress of navigating large, complex airport environments.

This repository contains the codebase for the entire system, with a focus on using AI to provide real-time navigation at airports. The system includes features such as finding gates, restaurants, bathrooms, and more—based on a user's current location and preferences.

Features
Real-time Navigation: Provides real-time guidance from the current location to the desired airport facility (e.g., gate, restaurant, restrooms).

Object Detection: Uses computer vision models to detect key points like gates, check-in counters, and other facilities in airport images and videos.

Dynamic Updates: The system adjusts routes based on real-time changes in airport layouts and flight schedules.

Wayfinding: Voice commands and interactive map integration for hands-free navigation.

Multilingual Support: The system can adapt to the user's preferred language.

Technologies Used
Backend: Python (Flask/Django)

Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

AI/ML Models:

YOLOv5 for object detection

TensorFlow for machine learning tasks

OpenCV for image processing

APIs:

Google Maps API for route calculation and navigation

Airport real-time data APIs (for flight schedules, gate locations)

Cloud Services: AWS for hosting and database storage

Database: MongoDB for storing user preferences and routes

Security: JWT for secure authentication

Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airport-navigation.git
cd airport-navigation
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure to install the necessary Python and Node.js dependencies. In the project folder, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Backend (Python)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend (Node.js)
cd frontend
npm install
3. Set up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

env
Copy
Edit
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URI=your-database-uri
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key
4. Run the Application
Start the backend server:
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Start the frontend server:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

How It Works
The system consists of three main parts:

User Input: Users can enter their current location or allow the system to detect it through GPS or Wi-Fi.

AI-Powered Navigation: Using object detection and machine learning, the system processes real-time video feeds or images of the airport and detects key navigation points like gates, restrooms, security checks, etc.

Route Calculation: The system calculates the most efficient route using real-time data from Google Maps API and integrates flight schedule information for dynamic updates.

User Guidance: Once the route is calculated, the system provides turn-by-turn directions via a visual map and/or voice commands. It also adapts in real-time based on new inputs such as changes in flight schedules, crowded areas, or blocked paths.

Airport Navigation
Key Features of Airport Navigation:
Airport navigation is one of the core functionalities of this project. It leverages real-time data, computer vision models, and AI-powered systems to create an intuitive wayfinding solution for passengers at airports. Here’s how it works:

Initial Setup: When a user enters the airport or opens the navigation system, the AI first locates the user’s position by either GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, or an integrated device locator.

Facility Recognition: Using machine learning models (like YOLOv5 and TensorFlow), the system scans the current airport environment to recognize key facilities—gates, restrooms, check-in counters, restaurants, lounges, etc.

Route Calculation: Once the user selects a destination (e.g., Gate 12, Starbucks), the system dynamically calculates the best path based on several factors:

Flight Schedules: It checks if there are any flight-related changes and suggests alternate routes if necessary.

Crowd Density: If certain areas of the airport are too crowded, the system recalculates the route to avoid congestion.

Real-time Conditions: Using Google Maps and airport APIs, the system also checks for any obstructions (e.g., closed areas, construction zones) and adapts the path accordingly.

Interactive Map: The user receives an interactive, step-by-step guide on a map. The map updates in real-time, and the system alerts the user about upcoming turns, escalators, and other landmarks.

Voice Commands: For convenience, the system provides voice instructions alongside the visual map to guide the user hands-free through the airport.

Usage Instructions
1. Navigating to a Facility
Once the app is open, you can input your destination (e.g., “Gate 12”, “Starbucks”).

The system will detect your current location.

It will display a real-time map and guide you through the airport.

2. Voice Navigation
If you prefer a hands-free experience, simply click on the microphone icon to give voice commands, such as:

“Find the nearest restroom.”

“Guide me to Gate 12.”

“How far is the nearest restaurant?”

3. Dynamic Updates
The system will update you about flight schedule changes, construction zones, and areas of high congestion.

If there is an issue (e.g., a delay), the system will offer an alternate route.

4. Real-Time Flight Updates
The system integrates with airport APIs to fetch real-time flight data (gate changes, boarding times, etc.), so you’re always up to date.
